# dplyrExamples
A series of data munging examples using Hadley's dplyr and friends. Initially created for the Feb 2016 meetup
of the Berkeley R group which was devoted to dplyr.

NOTE: For convenience, I've put the PDFs of the vignettes in the vignettes/PDFs folder. (These are ignored in package builds)
