When attempting to understand customers from their observed behavior, recorded as events, it is typically useful to sessionize the event stream to correspond to a single customer engagement. Also these individual sessions can be aggregated to give a high level characterization of each customer. 

I have been talking about these issues for a few years. See my achives [here](http://ds4ci.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/large-data-methods-bdbf-sf-2012.pdf) and [here](http://ds4ci.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sessionization-methods-bdx-berkeley-2013.pdf). Most recently, I presented [Structuring Data for Self-serve Customer Insights](http://bit.ly/1X3MQOJ) at ODSC West in November 2015.

For this example, we use the infamous 3.5 million row AOL search data set which was used in [a recent Stanford class](http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp10/assignments/assignment2.html). See also the [AOL Readme](http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp10/assignments/U500k_README.txt). The .ZIP is included in this package in the extdata folder.

#### Load the raw AOL search data
```{r LoadAOL}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyrExamples)
t0 <- Sys.time()
fn <- system.file("extdata", "user-ct-test-collection-01.zip", package = "dplyrExamples")
aol <- read_tsv(fn)
(Elapsed <- Sys.time() - t0)
glimpse(aol)
```
